Monthly Investment (Bitcoin): The amount you want to invest in Bitcoin every month.
Start Date: The date when you plan to start your investment (format: YYYY-MM-DD).
End Date: The date when you want to end your investment (format: YYYY-MM-DD). By default, it's set to the current date.

## Features
The application fetches historical Bitcoin price data from the bitcoin_prices_daily.csv file, which should be present in the repository root.

Monthly investments are simulated using the provided investment amount, and the profit or loss is calculated for each month.
The total investment amount, total exit amount, and the overall profit or loss are displayed at the end.
